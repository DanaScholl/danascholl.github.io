<li><b> Always bring a headshot AND a resume</b> <br>
While you may think that an audition is not like your typical interview, in a sense, it is! This is a common misconception among new actors. The producers and directors want to see why you are qualified AKA a resume. They also want to remember what you look like, for casting purposes. </li><br>
<li> <b> Know your part</b><br>
Spend time learning everything that you can about the part you are auditioning for. I am not kidding, this step can take hours. Knowing your part is one of the most important things to do before you show up. Do all the research you can, whether you are reading a book or even fan fiction online. Know your character and their personality, quirks, friendships, family, downfall---everything. By doing this, you will be able to become the character, not just impersonate them! </li><br>
<li><b> Memorize, but if you can not---do not!</b><br>
Memorizing is important and can help the producers and directors envision you as the part. While it is important, it is not the end of the world if you cannot. The producers and directors would rather hear the script read correctly, in comparison to you making up stuff. If you are not completely memorized, do not pretend you are. People get parts by reading off a script, it happens. </li><br>
<li> <b> No excuses EVER</b><br>
If you have a cold, are late or temporarily forget something, keep it to yourself! Producers and directors want you to do your best and if you get the job, there will be no time for excuses.  </li><br>
<li> <b> Be confident</b><br>
Auditioning is a difficult process, but every moment counts. Being confident from start to finish will greatly increase your chances in making a good impression. It a tough industry, but being shy or uncertain will get you nowhere! Walk in with confidence--- it will help in the long run. </li><br>
<li><b> Do not start over</b><br>
People mess up, we get that, but do not ever start over! Power through and prove that you can roll with the punches. Having a great recovery could be a reason you get a role. </li><br>
<li><b> PRACTICE</b><br>
The old saying practice makes perfect 100% applies to auditioning. You have to start somewhere to get used to the process, get out the jitters and learn how to manage your nerves. Every time you decide, not to audition, you lose a chance to learn. That means, always take the time to do it. Even if you do not get the part (and you probably will not in the beginning!) take every audition as a learning opportunity. Most directors and produces will give you tips to improve, and if they do not, ask them to!  </li><br>
